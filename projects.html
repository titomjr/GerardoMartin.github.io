                <p>For my senior capstone project, me and 3 classmates participated in the NASA Texas Space Grant Consortium
                    design challenge. Our task was to develop a proof-of-concept system that would track
                    up to 4 individuals inside an area roughly 6 meters in diameter. The purpose of this project is to understand
                    the psychological and behavioral effects of isolation during long space-flights.

                <p>The system we designed involves multiple Pixy2.1 cameras, each paired with their own ESP32 microcontroller. 
                    These cameras detect unique colored-patches that the crew members would wear.
                    Each ESP32 sends raw data from the cameras to a centralized microcontroller, where the data is processed and the final
                    position and orientation of each crew member is saved onto an SD card.

                <h2 id="PID">PID Controller for a given plant</h2>
                <p>I designed a PID controller in MATLAB and TopSPICE with a 21.4% 
                    overshoot and a time-to-peak of 57.1 milliseconds for a plant 
                    system with poles at 40, 50, and 90 rad/s. The first step was 
                    verifying the transfer function of the plant system given its poles. 
                    I produced bode plots for the SPICE schematic and MATLAB and 
                    compared the magnitudes of both at various frequencies. To eliminate 
                    any steady-state error, I added an integral channel with a pole 
                    at the origin and a zero at 10% of the nearest pole. My goal 
                    with the derivative channel was to decrease the time-to-peak 
                    by 30%.
